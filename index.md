## About me

I'm a PhD student at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/Pages/default.aspx) in the [Mechatronics group](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/e2/research/systems-and-control/Pages/Mechatronics.aspx), within the division of Systems and Control. My research topic consists of robotic manipulation of deformable objects using learning-based methods. My position is funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, as part of the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org/). I previously also completed my Master studies at Chalmers, where I did my thesis work within the [Biomechatronics and Neurorehabilitation Lab](http://www.bnl.chalmers.se/wordpress/). My focus was on implementing Deep Learning methods for myoelectric control, which has applications in robotic prosthetics and neuromuscular rehabilitation.
